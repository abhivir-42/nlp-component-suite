# NLP Component Suite

An Extensible Language Modeling Toolkit implementing modular components for natural language processing tasks with a focus on industry best practices.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a production-grade language modeling framework that transforms academic concepts into industry-standard implementations. It includes:

- **Autograd Core**: MicroGrad-based engine with CUDA acceleration
- **Architecture Zoo**: MLP/WaveNet/Transformer with unified API
- **Training Framework**: Makemore-inspired pipeline with modern optimizations
- **Diagnostic Suite**: Gradient visualization & model interpretability tools

## 🛠️ Getting Started

- Poetry (dependency management)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nlp-component-suite.git

## 📊 Professionalization Roadmap

This project follows a clear path to transform educational concepts into production-ready systems:

1. **Foundation**: Implement core ML components based on PyTorch
2. **CI/CD**: Add GitHub Actions pipelines for testing and deployment
3. **Cloud Deployment**: Integrate with AWS/GCP/Azure
4. **Optimization**: Add quantization and distributed training
5. **LLM Agent**: Develop RAG workflows
6. **Monitoring**: Implement Prometheus/Grafana dashboards
